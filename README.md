Purpose to analyze and use multiple models to produce accurate predictions of Iris Flower Dataset.

Flower Type: There are three different species of the iris flower, all with a different septal and pedal length/width. Using XGBoost and SVC
methods I am able to predict which species of the iris flower is which by grouping them based on the spetal and pedal clusters.
